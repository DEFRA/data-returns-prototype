	<p class="lede">This data standard tells us how to format and work with Date and Time information. Use of this data standard results in dates and times being consistently formatted.  This consistency increases completeness, clarifies the date/time precision, reduces chance of error, removes ambiguity, reduces uncertainty and increases the interoperability of our data and systems.</p>

				<h3 class="heading-medium">Character Definitions</h3>
				<p>The following character definitions are used in this Quick Guide:</p>
					<ul class="list list-bullet">
						<li>[Y] represents a digit used in the time element “year”;</li>
						<li>[M] represents a digit used in the time element “month”;</li>
						<li>[D] represents a digit used in the time element “day”;</li>
						<li>[h] represents a digit used in the time element “hour”;</li>
						<li>[m] represents a digit used in the time element “minute”;</li>
						<li>[s] represents a digit used in the time element “second”;</li>
						<li>“T” represents the start of the time component of a recorded date and time.</li>
					</ul>

				<h3 class="heading-medium">Date Format</h3>
				<p>A date is recorded as YYYY-MM-DD where:</p>
				<ul class="list list-bullet">
					<li>[YYYY] is the full 4-digit year;</li>
					<li>[MM] is the 2-digit calendar month number from 01 to 12, with a leading “0” inserted for the months of January to September e.g. “01” for January;</li>
					<li>&nbsp;[DD] is the calendar day from 01 to 31 (01 to 30 for April, June, September and November and 01 to 28 for February with 29 in a leap year) with a leading “0” inserted for days before the 10th day of a month e.g. “02” for 2 January;</li>
					<li>The separator character is a hyphen “-“.</li>
					<li>Examples: 3 September 1972 is recorded as 1972-09-03.</li>
				</ul>

				<h3 class="heading-medium">Time Format</h3>
				<p>A time is recorded as hh:mm:ss where:</p>
				<ul class="list list-bullet">
					<li>[hh] is the full 2-digit hour using the 24-hour clock that runs from 00 to 23 with a leading “0” inserted for the hours before 10am e.g.“07” for 7am.</li>
					<li>[mm] is the full 2-digit minute that runs from 00 to 60 with a leading “0” inserted for the minutes before 10 minutes e.g.“06” for 6 minutes;</li>
					<li>[ss] is the full 2-digit second that runs from 00 to 60, with a leading “0” inserted for the seconds before 10 seconds e.g.“02” for 2 seconds;</li>
					<li>The separator character is a colon “:“.</li>
					<li>Examples: Four seconds past 7:13am is recorded as 07:13:04.&nbsp; Ten seconds past 11:04pm is recorded as 23:04:10.</li>
				</ul>

				<h3 class="heading-medium">Date and Time Format</h3>
				<p>Date and Time are recorded together as YYYY-MM-DDThh:mm:ss (although by agreement of both parties in data exchange, the “T” may be dropped and replaced with a single space i.e. YYYY-MM-DD hh:mm:ss) where:</p>
				<ul class="list list-bullet">
					<li>Date is recorded as above;</li>
					<li>Time is recorded as above;</li>
					<li>A “T” is inserted between the Date and Time.</li>
					<li>Examples: Four seconds past 7:13am on 3 September 1972 is recorded as 1972-09-02T07:13:04.&nbsp; Ten seconds past 11:04pm on 16 December 2013 is recorded as 2013-12-16T23:04:10.</li>
				</ul>

				<h3 class="heading-medium">Reduced Precision Formats</h3>
				<p>If a precise Date and Time is not required (or is not actually known), the full <a href="#_Date_and_Time">Date and Time</a> format can be amended by omitting digits and characters, starting from the extreme right-hand side.</p>
				<p>This has the effect of reducing the precision of the recorded Date and Time.</p>
				<p>Examples:</p>
				<table>
					<tr>
						<th>Situation</th>
						<th>Action</th>
						<th>Example</th>
					</tr>
					<tr>
						<td>If you need the exact date and time to the nearest second</td>
						<td>Record full date and time</td>
						<td>2013-09-03 12:01:56</td>
					</tr>
					<tr>
						<td>If you need the date and time to the nearest minute</td>
						<td>Omit seconds from the time element</td>
						<td>2013-09-03 12:01</td>
					</tr>
					<tr>
						<td>If you need the date and time to the nearest hour</td>
						<td>Omit seconds from the time element</td>
						<td>2013-09-03 12</td>
					</tr>
					<tr>
						<td>If you need the date to the nearest day</td>
						<td>Omit the time element</td>
						<td>2013-09-03</td>
					</tr>
					<tr>
						<td>If you need the date to the nearest month</td>
						<td>Omit the day and time elements</td>
						<td>2013-09</td>
					</tr>
					<tr>
						<td>If you need the year</td>
						<td>Omit the month, day and time elements</td>
						<td>2013</td>
					</tr>
				</table>

				<h3 class="heading-medium">Date and Time Range</h3>
				<p>For a Date and Time range, use the <a href="#_Date_and_Time">Date and Time</a> format above for the time of the start interval and again for the end interval with a forward slash “/” as a separator character i.e.</p>
				<p>YYYY-MM-DDThh:mm:ss/YYYY-MM-DDThh:mm:ss <a href="#_Reduced_Precision_Formats">Reduced precision formats</a> can also be used in Date and Time ranges.</p>
				<p>Examples:</p>
				<table border="1" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" width="523">
					<tr>
						<th>Situation</th>
						<th>Action</th>
						<th>Example</th>
					</tr>
					<tr>
						<td>If you need the exact date and time range to the nearest second</td>
						<td>Record full dates and times with the slash separator</td>
						<td>2013-09-03T12:01:56/2014-09-04T 12:30:04</td>
					</tr>
					<tr>
						<td>If you need the date and time range to the nearest minute</td>
						<td>Omit seconds from the time element</td>
						<td>2013-09-03T12:01/2014-09-04T12:30</td>
					</tr>
					<tr>
						<td>If you need the date range to the nearest day</td>
						<td>Omit the time element</td>
						<td>2013-09-03/2014-09-04</td>
					</tr>
					<tr>
						<td>If you need the date range to the nearest month</td>
						<td>Omit the day and time elements</td>
						<td>2013-09/2014-09</td>
					</tr>
					<tr>
						<td>If you need the range from year to year</td>
						<td>Omit the day, month and time elements</td>
						<td>2013/2014</td>
					</tr>
				</table>

				<h3 class="heading-medium">Date Range Terms</h3>
				<p>Date Range terms and their meanings are as follows:</p>
				<table>
					<tr>
						<th>Term</th>
						<th>Meaning</th>
					</tr>
					<tr>
						<td>Quarter 1</td>
						<td>Jan-Mar YYYY</td>
					</tr>
					<tr>
						<td>Quarter 2</td>
						<td>Apr-Jun YYYY</td>
					</tr>
					<tr>
						<td>Quarter 3</td>
						<td>Jul-Sep YYYY</td>
					</tr>
					<tr>
						<td>Quarter&nbsp; 4</td>
						<td>Oct-Dec YYYY</td>
					</tr>
					<tr>
						<td>First half of the Year</td>
						<td>Jan-Jun YYYY</td>
					</tr>
					<tr>
						<td>Second half of the Year</td>
						<td>Jul-Dec YYYY</td>
					</tr>
					<tr>
						<td>Calendar Year</td>
						<td>YYYY</td>
					</tr>
					<tr>
						<td>Financial Year</td>
						<td>YY/YY or YYYY/YY</td>
					</tr>
				</table>

				<h3 class="heading-medium">Date and Time in IT Software</h3>
				<p>Date and Time data must not be stored in databases as strings or digits but in the pre-defined Date and Time format of the database software concerned.&nbsp; Client software interfacing with the database must display and transfer Date and Time data in a way that is consistent with this Quick Guide.</p>
