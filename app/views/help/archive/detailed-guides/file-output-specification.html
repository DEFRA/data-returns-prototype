<div class="file-output-specification">
	<p>Data Exchange Files can be output from existing data systems as comma separated values (csv), XML (specific xml schema to follow) or a very simple column based spreadsheet. The data elements are given below with a description, an example and an indication of a data standard or a reference to one of the Data Standards included later in the document.  This is a generic specification that has been designed to cover a number of different regulatory regimes that require compliance data. Some of the data elements given below are not relevant for every regime or every sample type, for instance
		<i>Monitoring End Date</i> would only be relevant where the measurement covers a period of time, e.g. monthly water use,  and is superfluous for spot samples. Other data elements are always required, for instance the 'Return Type' which enables us to identify the requirement against which the data has been submitted and an 'Unique EA Identifier', for instance a Permit Reference, which enables us to identify information about the data element, such as the site and operator name to which it relates, without the need to specifically include that in full, in the output itself.  Regime Specific Rules set out what should be provided in each case.</p>
	<p>A single output file may contain rows of data covering more than one site or permit and/or covering more than one return type.</p>
	<p>The Field Headings of the output file are given in the table below. These can be provided in any order but the field headings must exactly match the 'short description'.</p>
