  How to prepare your data file
</h2>
<ol class="list list-number text">
  <li>
    Your data file should be a comma-separated values (CSV) file. You can use spreadsheet software such as Excel to create a CSV file. Or you can set up your data management systems to produce an automated export of data in the correct format.
  </li>
  <li>
    Include column headings as the first row. Use the correct column heading shown in the data rules. The columns can be in any order. The column heading tells our system what data is in that column.
  </li>
  <li>
    List each reading or measurement in its own row.
  </li>
  <li>
    Check the data rules to make sure you have the correct data in each column. You can use the service to check the files before you send them.
  </li>
</ol>

<p class="text">
  If you wish to, you can send data returns for more than one permit type in the same file. The maximum file size allowed is 2MB. Split the files if they are larger than this.
