					<h2>General EA data formatting rules</h2>
					<p>Before you send your landfill data returns file you need to apply data formatting rules under fixed field headings. This will help you meet Environment Agency data standards, reduce ambiguity and improve consistency in your data returns.</p>
					<p>You can set up your data management systems to produce an automated export of data in the correct format then you need to save your file as CSV to send it online.</p>
					<p>You can use the online service to submit landfill emissions compliance data covering up to 18 months in the past.</p>

						<h2 id="data-rules">Landfill compliance monitoring: data formatting rules</h2>

						<p>These rules explain how you must prepare and present compliance monitoring data for landfill operations according to each field heading in your file.</p>
						<p>You must use the short field headings in your file. You can send data under the short headings in any order.</p>
						<p>Some fields are mandatory for all data returns. Where possible you should give data for other fields as specified in your permit or licence and particular type of return.</p>
						<p>Some fields only accept entries from the Environment Agency <a href="/">controlled lists</a> of standard terms, which you can download to apply in your software.</p>
